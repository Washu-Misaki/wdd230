            <p>
                White Space is a concept used in any design wherein areas in which you are viewing are left 
                purposefully empty.  Although some people see this as wasted space where more information or 
                other visual elements, placing white space in select locations allow for the users to enjoy 
                their experience on a website by not being overloaded all at once.  Proper use of white space 
                also makes for a cleaner, more professional design.  The space itself need not be white, just 
                a space in which there is a lack of page content.  Any color, texture, or even background 
                image can be used as white space!
            </p>
            <p>
                The BBC displays this concept well, with both margins around different elements so that they 
                are not cramped together, and also with a nice wide space on either side of the page's content 
                to make the section you are focusing your attention on smaller.  Even with a screen as wide as 
                some people have for their desktop, limiting the width of your content can improve a person's desire 
                to remain on your website since they aren't being overstimulated by everything you have to show.

            <p>The Hick-Hyman Law, commonly known as Hick's Law, is a principle in which when presented with
                multiple choices, a person requires more time to make their choice from those options. This
                time increases the more options a person is presented with.  Although there are exceptions to
                this law, such as when the person knows which decision they will make before being presented 
                with their options, when a person is presented with more options than they are willing to do 
                the work to decide upon, they will generally abandon all choice and dismiss them all to avoid 
                undesired work.  This is also true in Web Design.  In general, it is best to keep things 
                both simple, while being effective.
            </p>
            <p>An example of this is from FanFiction.net's website.  
                Millions of stories are presented there, but when using the website they are divided by category 
                and you can further filter the stories to your preference.  Once having done so you are only 
                presented with the stories that match your criteria, and still have the option to narrow it down 
                further.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p class="company">Fantasy Grounds</p>

            <p>
                The Rule of Thirds is a straightforward idea; you place a simple grid overlay (divided equally 
                into thirds, both horizontally and vertically) on the space to be used for the design.  When 
                you have done this, you should have 9 equally sized boxes and 4 primary intersections where the 
                'lines' of your grid meet.  These four intersections are the 'sweet spots' of your layout, and 
                each one has a point of importance associated with it, moving from top to bottom, then left to 
                right.  If you prepare your design with these points in mind and place your elements according to 
                what is most important to the appropriate intersections your website will have a layout easier 
                for the users to read and understand the website's purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Fantasy Grounds website, a primary use of the Rule of Thirds occurs in their display of 
                game systems they support.  The image used displays the names (in their logo style) of the 
                different TTRPGs their program supports.  In the top left intersection point, were you to lay a 
                grid down using this rule, are the most well known and popular titles.  The bottom left is next, 
                followed by the top right and bottom right.
